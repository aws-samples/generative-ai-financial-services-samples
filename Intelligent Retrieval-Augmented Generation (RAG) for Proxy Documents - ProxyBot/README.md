3. Amazon Textract
4. An orchestrating workflow to get started for the `AOSS` with necessary permissions setting, extracted text files with summarization.
5. Use of modern Generative AI tools like `streamlit` and `langchain`.

## 2.0 Architecture (To be updated)

### 2.1 Overall Workflow Architecture
![Overall Workflow](assets/workflow.png)

## 3.0 Getting started

1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to the working directory

```bash
cd aws-generative-ai-financial-services-examples/fs_04_intelligent_rag_chatbot
```

3. It is recommended to use a virtual environment (preferably a `conda` virtual environment, due to some packages dependencies).
4. If you are on any of the following operating systems, do the following:
   - **Windows**: Download and install the [Anaconda Distribution for Windows](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows/).
   - **Mac**: Follow the instruction for [MacOS here](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/mac-os/)
   - **Linux**: Please the installation link for Linux [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/linux/). Please be mindful of the flavour of Linux distribution you have.

   As an alternative, you could run the provided `installation.sh` script for installation. This will only work for `Cloud9` or `EC2` or `local` linux machine. This will download and install the Anaconda Distribution framework. Remember to the following:

   ```bash
   chmod +x installation.sh
   bash installation.sh
   ```

> [!WARNING]
> If you would like to use Amazon Cloud9, please see section below for details and minimum requirements.


### 3.1 Managed Environment (conda preferred)

After the Anaconda Distribution installation is complete. Do the following:

1. Create a conda working environment as shown below:

```bash
conda create --name advancedragenv python=3.10 -y
```

2. Then activate the environment

```bash
conda activate advancedragenv
```

### 3.2 Package Installation

#### 3.2.1 Using Poetry (recommended)

It is recommended to use `poetry` as this will help to manage cross-OS dependencies. 

> [!CAUTION]
> Make sure you have installed the Anaconda Distribution and have created and activated your working environment.

1. Install the `poetry` package. See [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/) for more details.

```bash
pip install poetry
```

2. In the main working directory, install the required packages with their python packages and operating system dependencies. This uses the `poetry.lock` and `pyproject.toml` files (please do not edit this files manually).

```bash
cd aws-generative-ai-financial-services-examples/fs_04_intelligent_rag_chatbot
poetry install
```

3. Poetry manages the environment internally, to leverage this, please activate the environment as follows:

```bash
poetry shell
```

When the environment is activated, `poetry will detect or activate its own virtual environment.

If you need to deactivate the enabled poetry shell, simply type `exit`.


#### 3.2.2 Using Conda environment with `requirements.txt`

Please ensure you have the [Anaconda Distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/) installed by following your respective operating system steps. And have created and activated your working environment.

1. Installing needed packages
Use the `requirements.txt` for packages installation as shown below.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> [!WARNING]
> You can use the native Python environment <i>venv</i> but be mindful of the package dependencies.

If the above steps were successful, you should be able to continue the next steps.

## 4.0 Roles and Policies

Before using any of Amazon Web Services (AWS), please check the following:

1. Ensure you have followed the steps under the [Getting started with AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) to make sure you can communicate with AWS and its services.
2. For the purpose of running things smoothly, it is recommended you have your AWS credentials configured to a profile, if not the `default` profile will be used. You can also provide your AWS credentials on the terminals.
3. Since we will be using [Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html), please ensure you have model access for the required models - **Amazon Titan Embeddings** and **Anthropic Claude 3**.
4. A `config.ini` file has been provided to help with certain dependent variables. For example, you will need unique `s3` prefix. Please update this file accordingly for your use case execution.
5. **Creating Policies and Permissions**: Please ensure you have all the necessary permissions to create the following AOSS related policies. If you do have permissions already, please set the `run_permission` to `False` in the `config.ini`. And ensure `aoss_action` is set to `True` to remove old AOSS with same names.

- `iam:CreatePolicy`
- `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole`
- `aoss:CreateCollection`
- `aoss:CreateSecurityPolicy`
- `aoss:APIAccessAll`
- `aoss:DashboardsAccessAll`
- `s3:*`
- `textract:*`
- `aoss:*"`
- `osis:Ingest"`
- `secretsmanager:*`
- `bedrock:*`

7. ~If you would like to create a username (not recommended), ensure to set your `username`, if not leave as empty. The `username` is used for the role.~
8. Update the `config.ini` with the `task_prefix` and update other entities as much as needed. The `task_prefix` is used to define the Amazon Opensearch Serverless policies.

A sample extract of the `config.ini` is shown below: Update the placeholder `xxxxxxxxxxxx` with yours.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> It is crucial that you maintain the same order for the `ticker_list` and the `ticker_company_name` as this must match the sequence for the `data` folder. For example, `AAPL` is in teh first position for the `ticker_list`, so `Apple` must be in the first position for `ticker_company_name` also.

All the needed files have been provided in the data folder in `YYYY.pdf` format. `2024.pdf` under `data/AAPL` _et cetera_.

For a quicker run, you can use just one ticker, which means there must only be that `ticker` folder in the `data` folder. This has been done to maintain proper stucture for indexing and query search.

```bash
[ticker_list]
...
ticker_list = AAPL, AMZN, BR, GOOGL, MSFT
ticker_company_name = Apple, Amazon, Broadridge, Alphabet, Microsoft
start_year = 2021

[aws_params]
...
profile_name = 
region_name = us-east-1
runtime = True

[s3_buckets]
bucket_prefix = xxxxxxxxxxxx

[secret]
aoss_credentials_name = xxxxxxxxxxxx

[identity_access_role_policy]
username = 
role_name = GFSAOSSRoleBespoke
policy_name = GFSAOSSPolicyBespoke

[runtime_action]
run_permision = True
aoss_action = True

[opensearch]
task_prefix = xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Note that the `start_year` must also cover the minimum date of the document.

## 5.0 Running the Application.

There are **four** main stages for running the app. Instead of running the first three stages individually, you can use the provided `run_setup_processes.sh` to make a single run for steps 1, 2 and 3. Use `run_setup_processes.bat` for Windows OS user.

> [!WARNING]
> If at any point there is any error, please check the log and fix the issues. You will have to do a clean up before restarting the script again. So run `04_run_cleanup.py` and then run `run_setup_processes.sh` or `run_setup_processes.bat` again. Be mindful that there are intentional time delay in the code scripts to allow for cool offs.

**You do not need to run steps 1, 2 and 3 again if you have had a successful run of the provided script.

**Step 1. General Settings and Permissions**: This involves creating all the necessary settings, access and permissions. It also creates the `s3` buckets and Opensearch Serverless credential. This stage is done in the file - `01_run_aoss.py`. You only require to run this stage once.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you provide your temporary credentials on the terminal, be mindful of the expiration time and ensure you set **AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1** also.

**Step 2. Running Textract**: This stage is done by `02_run_textract.py`. Smple data have been provided with respective sub-folders as company `ticker`. For this use case, we have added Apple (`AAPL`), Amazon (`AMZN`), Broadridge (`BR`), Alphabet (`GOOGL`) and Microsoft (`MSFT`). Each ticker folder has SEC forms with dates. This is done for demo purposes as this structure helps with interactions with other AWS services like `s3` and Opensearch Serverless (`AOSS`). If you need to add more tickers, ensure to update the `[ticker_list]` accordingly and add the necessary files in the data folder.
The SEC documents are first uploaded to `s3` bucket suffixed `-pdf-data`. Your full `s3` bucket should start with the specified `bucket_prefix` in the `config.ini` file.

Below is the data folder structure sample structure.
```
â”œâ”€ data
   â”œâ”€â”€ AAPL/              
   â”œâ”€â”€ AMZN/
   â”œâ”€â”€ BR/              
   â”œâ”€â”€ GOOGL/
   â”œâ”€â”€ MSFT/
```
After the original documents are uploaded to the `s3` bucket, the next step is the textract extraction. This is currently set to run and save extracted files located (you can modify this to write directly to `s3`).

**Step 3. Data Ingestion to Opensearch Serverless (AOSS)**: This stage handles the ingestion of processed chaptered text files (stored locally for demo purposes), creation of vector embeddings and the indexing and storing of the vector embeddings into the earlier created AOSS vector index. This stage is executed by running the `03_run_ingestion.py`. Allow some time for this ingestion to complete. You can check the created `logs` folder for the process logs.

**Step 4. Running the Streamlit App**: See following section.

### 5.1 Running code option

### 5.1.1 Locally

To run the code locally, run the `app.py` as follows:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
This should pop up on your browser, if not type the localhost link as shown below:

`http://localhost:8501/`

### 5.1.2 Using AWS Cloud9

To use Cloud9, please ensure the following:

1. Follow the entire setup processes above.
2. Ensure your Cloud9 has sufficient memory and disk storage, if not you won't be able to run the code as this requires sufficient memory and disk storage. This [link](https://ec2spotworkshops.com/ecs-spot-capacity-providers/workshopsetup/resize_ebs.html) can help. Be patience with this, it might take a few minutes. **And reboot to have the changes effected.**
3. It is recommended to have a minimum of `40 GB` disk space and minimum `16 GB` RAM for the Cloud9.
4. Run the `conda_installation.sh` script and restart the terminal to have `conda` active.
5. With new Cloud9, temporary default credentials are usually set, but to be on a safer side, please provide your temporary AWS credentials. And make sure you set `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1`.

```bash
chmod +x conda_installation.sh
bash conda_installation.sh
```
6. Then create and activate your `conda` environment. Check above for more details on the `conda` environment creation and activation.
7. Follow all the other setup scripts above also to continue.

> [!WARNING]
> If you get an `InvalidTokenId` error and you are using **AWS managed temporary credentials**, your access might be restricted. For more information, see the [temporary managed credentials url](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/security-iam.html#auth-and-access-control-temporary-managed-credentials).


### 5.1.3 Container Execution (#TOBEFIXED)

It is recommended to run this app in a container.

1. Build the conatiner image.
```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache
```
2. Start the container image.

```bash
docker-compose up
```
The ProxyBot app server will start automatically. But note that you need to copy the link to your browser. If you are running docker locally, please use `http://localhost:8501/`, if on EC2, access the public URL it provided (http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8501) in a browser.

### 5.1.4 Running on an EC2 - (TOBEADDED, similar to Cloud9)

Also, you can run the entire code on an EC2. The instructions to get this demo running on an EC2 instance is similar to Cloud9's

You will be required to: 
1. Use the EC2 console to open up the security group's inbound rules to allow all IPv4 traffic to for the port Streamlit returned (8501)
2. Access the public URL it provided (http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8501) in a browser.
